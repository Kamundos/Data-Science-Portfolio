# Data-Science-Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purpose, presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. It is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning projects

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.
